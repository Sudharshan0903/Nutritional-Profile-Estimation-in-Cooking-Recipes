# Nutritional-Profile-Estimation-in-Cooking-Recipes
## 📌 Project Overview  
This project estimates the **nutritional profile** of cooking recipes using **machine learning** techniques. It helps users track their daily calorie intake based on food items and exercises. The system uses **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for classification and better accuracy.  

## 🏗️ Modules  
### 🔹 Admin Module  
- Add and manage food items with calorie counts.  
- View the nutritional breakdown of various ingredients.  

### 🔹 User Module  
- Input BMI and track calorie consumption.  
- Add food items and exercises to maintain a **personalized** nutrition log.  
- Get **nutrition recommendations** based on machine learning analysis.  

## 🔍 Machine Learning Approach  
- **Dataset**: The system references the **USDA dataset** for food nutritional values.  
- **Algorithm**: The core classification is handled by **SVM**, while other models are explored for accuracy improvement.  

## 💡 Features  
✅ Accurate **calorie tracking** based on food intake  
✅ **SVM-based food classification** for better predictions  
✅ Supports **multiple ML models** for improved accuracy  
✅ **User-friendly** interface for food & exercise logging  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (ML models, data processing)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine learning algorithms)  
- **Flask/Django** (If using a web-based interface)  
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (If using a database for storage)
